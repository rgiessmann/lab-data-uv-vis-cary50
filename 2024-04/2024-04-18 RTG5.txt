#x16: 
- 5uL from SH1 5.6.23 (CoSH) + 95uL x14 Tris
-> 1:20 dilution

#x17:
- 50uL from #x16 + 450uL x14 Tris
-> 1:200 dilution


UV/Vis campaign RTG5

to cuvette add:
1.9mL x14, h2 saturated

lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
add 50uL #x15 NAD+ with Hamilton syringe through stopper
add 5uL #x16 enzyme with Hamilton syringe through stopper
measure A340

A340 absorption goes straight up, with slope ~= 1 AU / min

should be slope=0.6


RTG6

prepare #x18:
to cuvette add:
1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
add 50uL #x15 NAD+
measure
A340 approx 0.206 in kinetics mode

turn to scan mode
measure baseline air
add cuvette and scan -> 2024-04-18-RTG-t1 (A340=.12)
  - A>1.0 below 288nm

add 10uL #x17 enzyme (1:200 dilution)
delay: 10 seconds to stop watch (when stop watch shows 10 seconds, add enzyme)

start scan at 0min30 stop watch -> t2 (A340=0.28)
start scan at 1min30 stop watch -> t3 (A340=0.63)
start scan at 2min30 stop watch -> t4 (A340=1.16)
start scan at 4min30 stop watch -> t5 (A340>2)
  - already unusable


RTG7
prepare #x19: as above
to cuvette add:
1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
measure cuvette -> 2024-08-18-RTG-blank
add 10uL #x4 with Hamilton syringe (was the one that was used for enzyme before :( )
measure -> -t0
change method to measure down to 200nm again; measure -> -t1
add 5uL #x17 enzyme at delay 0min10
start measurement at 0min35 -> t2
start measurement at 1min30 -> t3
start measurement at 3min00 -> t4
start measurement at 22min30 -> t5


RTG8
prepare #x20
to cuvette add:
1.9mL x14, h2 saturated
lock with rubber stopper, gas with h2
start to measure
add 50uL #x15 NAD+ at approx 1min00, mix by slight shaking of cuvette
add 20uL #x17 enzyme dilution (1:200) at approx 3min00, mix by slight shaking of cuvette
slope 0.7
